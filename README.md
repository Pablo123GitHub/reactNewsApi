#### How to install it 

In a terminal window : 

```
cd reactNewsApi
npm install 

```

#### How to run it 

Then you need to get an API token from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) website.

Create a .env file in the root folder in which you can paste in your API token : 


```
REACT_APP_API_KEY="123xyz"
```

123xyz needs to be your own API token
